Hey everyone! My name is Sjoukje and I'm an engineer based (remotely!) in Amsterdam. Usually I'm living it up in Glasgow but COVID-19 had other plans this year. 2020 was racing along at a speed I could almost not keep up with (events! panels! public speaking!) and when lockdown started and my holiday plans were dashed in March, I had some proper burn out symptoms. So I took a break! I finished teaching the Code First: Girls course I was doing at Strathclyde, took a step back from event organising with BCSWomen, and tried to focus on myself and my family.

The pandemic hit my community hard. I saw friends lose their jobs, recent grads not find jobs - people I'm close to were (and still are) very worried for the future that had previously seemed within reach. People I knew and didn't know started reaching out to me for advice on courses they could take, books they could read, companies I thought were cool and were still hiring, local tech communities that they could join to get them out of stressing about employment and in a career they enjoy and feel secure in. One night I put out a post asking if anyone was interested in this, and it received attention from 11 countries. This pandemic is a gamechanger for young people and they've known a long time that coding is a futureproof skill.

The reason I started this space was to provide resources for people who want to start long and happy careers in technology. I will aim to provide connections to communities, organisations and job boards I admire and have benefited from myself. I will also help demystify some common terms that fly around in the industry (what the heck is a hackathon? a sprint? a unicorn?)

I'm also starting something called Office Hours. If you would like my time, please book a slot for us to chat in the 'Let's Talk' tab! I've had lots of advice sessions and this is a way for me to streamline.

PS. I've also added a wee option to give me a coffee. If you feel you've enjoyed my content, make my day! I may develop some stickers or something soon!
