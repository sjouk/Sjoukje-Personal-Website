My first diversity in tech gathering was teaching web development for Code First Girls at the start of my second year of my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews. I had been one of few female students taking introductory computer science courses the year prior and had seen enough ‘tech bro culture’ to seek solace elsewhere - the first opportunity being lecturing a crowded lab filled with women like me wanting to learn how to code. Helping other women build confidence and excitement for coding and tech careers was cathartic and fulfilling for me and still is five years on.

Attending network events outside of my company allows me to learn about topics and technologies outside of my focus at work, and lets me meet people I otherwise would not cross paths with whether they hold far more senior positions or live outside of my city.

It goes without saying that you can’t be what you can’t see - it’s really hard to dive into the deep end of a new career without an idea of what your goals are. From my women in tech groups at university like CFG and SHE++ to the broader networks I joined such as BCSWomen Scotland, I learned to pick out which skills and qualities I needed to develop to become the professional I wanted to be from those who attended each meetup, lecture and workshop. Networks are a great place to meet future mentors, role models or people that will guide you to your next role in a more informal setting.

The benefits of joining a network early in my career seemed straightforward - accelerate my growth as a young professional, build a network and learn from lots of interesting people. What I hadn’t expected was to be embraced by my new communities on a more human level, that they would reassure and encourage me when I struggled and cheer me on when I took exciting chances in my life and career.

With most working or studying remotely, there has never been a better time to join your local diversity in tech or technical networks. Joining and contributing to a network allows you to grow your career and expand your horizons to new opportunities, skills and opinions. 

Men should also consider attending diversity in tech events to help push the gender equity in tech agenda forward. At BCSWomen we believe that diversity of thought is only possible when everyone’s voices are allowed to be heard, and we encourage men to join our conversations so that we can improve how we discuss and achieve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In turn, male attendees could find it rewarding to be able to learn about and champion this movement when they return to their workplaces.

Joining a network has increased my awareness of the setbacks that minority groups in tech experience in education and the workplace. When I attend events in my networks, whether it be at work or externally, I listen to how other women have overcome challenges to achieve success in the arcs of their careers. Sharing my story with others and hearing theirs made me realise that I was not alone in my experiences, which in turn fired me up to make the changes I wanted to see in my community.

I want to add that I agree with the adage that turning up is 80% of being successful. Absorbing the wealth of technical knowledge, local market insights and career wisdom from the amazing people that attend network events is priceless. Even as an early career woman in tech or first time attendee you’ll be welcomed with open arms. Surprise yourself with a new experience and turn up to your local women in tech network!
