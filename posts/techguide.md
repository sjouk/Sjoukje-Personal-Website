## *A guide from zero to hero*
The tech industry is incredibly broad, exciting and overwhelming. The job description ‘software engineer’ is only one of many, many roles needed to keep designing, creating and maintaining code and projects. Here are some paths that may appeal to you!

## **What jobs can I get?**
The tech industry is incredibly broad, exciting and overwhelming. The job description ‘software engineer’ is only one of many, many roles needed to keep designing, creating and maintaining code and projects. Here are some paths that may appeal to you!

#### Frontend Engineer
    Structures, codes and tests the user interface elements and functionality of the website
    Involved in design process 
#### Backend Engineer
    Structures, codes and tests the server side processes and services of the website
#### Fullstack Engineer
    A mix of frontend and backend engineering, spans all steps of the software development lifecycle
#### Platform engineer
#### Quality assurance engineer
#### Web Developer
    Someone who works on developing applications and programmes for the web
#### Product Designer
    Takes both customer and business requirements in mind when designing applications. Often the link between the engineering team and the UX team
#### User Experience Designer
    Primarily involved with the customer’s journey. Strong user advocate.

## **Your Learning Journey**
One of the first things I was taught was “don’t learn everything at once”. Choose one of the following that you naturally gravitate to and immerse yourself in it before branching out. I’m focussing on self teaching here. 

#### Programming (backend)
* Python: useful for data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, object-orientated programming
* Java: the most popular and widespread object oriented programming language in the world
* SQL: managing data

#### Design
* Figma (free pro account for students!) 
* InVision
* Sketch
* Webflow University (university.webflow.com)
* Fun resource guide! Choose your own adventure! (https://designresourc.es/)

#### Web development (frontend)
    * Code First: Girls (free course for female/non-binary students aged 18-25. Paid for female/non-binary identifying outside of that range)
    CodePen

## **Beginners ‘Learn to Code’ Resources**
“Where do I start?” is the most common question I get asked. These links are great places to start, to help you define your interests and get hands-on. Most are free, but the paid links are well worth the investment and won’t break the bank. 

#### Free
* Code First: Girls student courses
* How to automate the boring stuff Python (Python only)
* Codecademy (free courses cover the start but paid will teach you way more)

#### Paid
* Code First: Girls Career Switch courses
* SuperHi
* Udacity
* CodeClan (paid bootcamp in major Scottish cities, replacement for masters degree)

## **Tool Pack**
Get set up with the right tools! Here is the software I use on a daily basis. Pick one of each. All downloads are free and secure. 

1. Download a text editor (Atom, IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code)
2. Make a version control account (GitHub, Bitbucket)
3. Choose a browser (Chrome, Firefox)

## **Helpful tech communities**
Having a community you feel at home in is the absolute key to success in the tech industry. These can be local to you, niche tech groups online or generalist meetups. Here are a few in some locations I spend time in or know about. 

#### Online
* Code First: Girls (lunchtime talks + free/paid coding courses for women)
* Codebar (online ‘learn to code’ meetups) https://codebar.io/
#### London
* Rails Girls London (@twitter) 
#### Scotland
* Women in Technology Scotland (women in tech events)
* BCSWomen (monthly women in tech events)
* Data Science Scotland (Meetups)
* Ladies Of Code (monthly meetup - Glasgow) (@twitter)
* Codebar (various locations, regular ‘learn to code’ sessions)
* Code Craft UK (@twitter)
#### Nottingham
* Women in Tech Nottingham

## **Job Boards**
Job boards are a great way to quickly find relevant jobs for your area of interest or find vetted options from your community. 

## **Women in Tech job boards: **
* SheCanCode.io
* Code First: Girls 

## **Hackathons + Conferences + Tech Events**
These days everything is online, free and accessible. Attending extracurricular events are part of the developer experience. You’ll learn new skills and technologies, discover new career opportunities and grow your network. 

#### Hackathons 
A fast, timeboxed event where software developers and designers come together to complete one project from concept to finish. It usually has nothing to do with hacking and is almost always accessible for people from all technical skill levels and backgrounds. They’re really exciting and valuable because you get to plan, design, code and present your own project from start to finish. Some hackathons are a working day, but they can last up to 48 continuous hours (sleeping bags included!). Hackathons are an industry staple and most engineers participate in a few a year to get the chance to work on something new and with different people. Hackathons are usually themed by industry (eg. cyber security, health tech, fintech, climate change etc.) and can also be targeted at specific demographics (students, women, internal hackathons). It’s a great way to expand your network and your portfolio, travel to new cities or company offices, and win some cool prizes! 

#### Conferences
Similarly to other industries, conferences are THE way to improve your craft, learn from the best and make new connections. The tech industry is really good at offering a wide range of local and international conferences. Some are more like festivals! Best part is the free swag.

My favourites: Web Summit (Lisbon), Turing Fest (Edinburgh), Code First: Girls Conference (London), Dublin Tech Summit (Dublin), CodeLand (New York City + digital), CogX AI Summit (London + digital), WeAreTechWomen Conference (London + digital), React Summit (Amsterdam), Women of React (Toronto), Slush Conference (Helsinki)

## **Tech News + Inspirational Content**
I check these pretty much daily and pick out an article here and there to read during the day. 

* Dev.to (blogs + how to’s + day in the life posts)
* CodePen (web development creative space + sandbox)
* Hacker News (Y Combinator news)
* Wired

## **People I Admire**
Community is EVERYTHING. Learn and be inspired by the best. Here are some accounts I follow on Twitter (my corner of the internet for happy techies). Check them out!
