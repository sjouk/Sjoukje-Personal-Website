New year, new book list! I keep this portion of my blog updated with what I've been reading and what my thoughts were for each book. Have a suggestion for what I should read next? Get in touch!

## The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet - David Mitchell

In progress! I picked this one up because I enjoyed his more recent novel 'Cloud Atlas'. This book is about Dutch VOC merchants in Japan.

## Normal People - Sally Rooney

I was interested in reading this book initially because it's received a ton of acclaim, but ultimately I was disappointed in how superficially the two main character's personas were developed. For some background, this book is about two people who fall in love and are implied to be soulmates, yet continuously break up due to meaningless arguments and get together again out of habit. I enjoyed Rooney's concise writing style and undoubtedly consider her a great writer, but felt that some depth of character could have supported the plot and her characters' relationship. Banging Spotify playlist, I must add.

## On Chesil Beach - Ian McEwan

I read this cover to cover the day I finished Obama's memoir because I simply could not stop reading it. This book is about a newly married couple's falling out on their wedding night, encompassing their preceding relationship and ultimately detailing how the aftermath of a single night can influence you for a lifetime. I think this is a movie with Saoirse Ronan and I will definitely be watching it. Sublime.

## A Promised Land - Barack Obama

I received 'A Promised Land' for my 25th birthday in December, it was the only item I had on my wishlist and, wow, it did not dissapoint. Obama uses this rather thicc book (ie. 700 page chonker) to walk the reader through his senate and presidential campaigns and the first 3.5 years of his administration. As a politics junkie and the US being one of the countries I grew up in, getting an inside look into his decision-making was a delight. It took me a month to read this due to its length and the holidays, but I recommend it to everyone.

## The Crucible - Arthur Miller

This is a play about the Salem witch trials and, wow, what a thriller. I really liked the story, depth of characters.

## The Triffids - John Wyndham

I'll never look at a large plant the same way again. I read this in the middle of the first 2020 lockdown because it had a slightly apocolyptic blurb on the back which was definitely relevant the way the streets of my city were empty. Basically, aggressive, blinding and mysterious plants called Triffids take over central London, then the world, and we're taken on a wild ride as the protagonist navigates his battle against them. It's an instant classic and I really recommend it.
