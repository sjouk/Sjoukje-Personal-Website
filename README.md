# Sjoukje's Personal Website

Hey reader, welcome to my website! You can find out more about me or get in touch via Calendly. I am not a writer so don't expect many long musings, but can talk endlessly about developer education, my path into web3 so far, and my favourite museums and films. 

## Live

Check out my live site [here](http://www.sjoukje.netlify.app)!

## The Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I based this website off of a Cassidoo how-to she wrote for Netlify in 2020 and have been extending it to make it personal. Keepin' it fun and simple is my game.

## Run It In Dev

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
